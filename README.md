This is Fuji, mostly a learning project for me (html, web apps, etc.) but I thought maybe it could work for a simple chat application. 
It was originally thought of 6/21/19, and was started 6/23/19. It's being made in Python (flask, flask-socketio).
It is currently being made as of 6/25/19, and code will be uploaded once it is working. The web app also uses cookies. 

Again, it is a learning project and really isn't meant for actual use (at least not in a while.)
